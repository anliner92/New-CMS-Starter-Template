Hearing cars going racing past every two seconds, horns blaring, and security alarms attached to the building next door going off plus copious high-rise buildings being seen in the background can only mean that there is definitely a lack of fresh air.</p>\n<h2>Get Away From the Pressures of Work and Life</h2>\n<p>In this day and age I know it frustrates some people, but campsites are still very slow on the uptake of wifi connections and phone signals. Not great if you are a teenager addicted to facebook granted, but to know that regardless whether or not someone tries to phone you, they won’t be able to disturb your weekend away for me is complete and utter bliss.</p>\n<p>Going into a hotel often means that wifi is available but it also means that the allure of work is always within touching distance. When camping however, on the majority of campsite, internet signal is weak meaning that the desire to check emails soon wears off and you can get on with enjoying your holiday.</p>\n<h2>To Space to Make Friends</h2>\n<p>Even the most aloof of individuals will struggle not to smile and say hello on a campsite. Perhaps it is the morning walk to the shop to pick up the fresh bread and milk that causes everyone to feel slightly more affable or maybe it is because everyone has actually forgotten about the pressures of work and home life and have started to unwind and enjoy themselves – who knows?</p>\n<p>Camping entices people to socialise – to have a glass of wine together in the evenings, to strike up friendships strong enough to take the burnt sausages that will no doubt be flying off the BBQ on a warm summers evening.</p>\n<p>Children have the freedom to play without fear of being knocked over or told off. It does of course mean that they have to get use to not being attached to the latest computer game all day, but once that hurdle is jumped games like badminton, rounders and cricket start to sprout up everywhere. Games that they would never have dreamt of playing back home when technology will once again take over.</p>\n<h2>Exploring the Great Outdoors</h2>\n<p>Mention going for a walk at home and everyone in your household will give you a look that says ‘have you gone mad?’ Spend a few days outside however and before you know it you will have the whole family hiking up the neighbouring mountain, going on a family bike ride to the local village for a pub lunch or sauntering through fields, leisurely taking in your local surroundings.</p>\n<p>It seems that, regardless of our lifestyle at home, camping brings out the great adventurer in all of us.</p>\n<h2>Discover Wildlife and Enjoy Nature</h2>\n<p>Hands up if you have ever picked wild berries. As youngsters my siblings and I would often be caught picking the blackberries that grew randomly at the back of our parent’s garden. It meant that when we did head off on one of our many camping trips we loved to go foraging for tasty treats whenever we went wandering. Of course, you had to know what was safe and what would give you a funny tummy but after a few lessons from our dad we were well on our way and felt like little explorers.</p>\n<p>That’s the great thing about campsites and their location. On the whole many of them have places to wander where you can enjoy nature and potentially see a bit of wildlife every now and again.</p>\n<h2>Fun Family Time</h2>\n<p>This for me is probably the best reason to go camping.</p>\n<p>When you are able to switch off from the modern day world, you actually start to enjoy the company of your family again. When I think back, every camping trip I have ever been on with my family has resulted in a lot of laughter and enjoyment. Of course, the competitive edge of a family will always come out – for us it was normally over a game of cards or scrabble – but it was also a time where we would do things together as a family that we seldom did back home.</p>\n<p>If I had challenged my father to a game of badminton at home he would have flatly refused and yet, with each camping trip the badminton set was packed once again, in order for us two to continue our tournament (of course, there was never a winner because neither of us would accept defeat!).</p>\n<p>Camping is ultimately a place where fantastic memories can be made as a family.</p>\n<p>However, I understand not everyone wants to stay in a tent. Or perhaps, they like the idea of a tent but hate the thought of pitching one for themselves and then spending two weeks on hard ground with just a thin roll mat for comfort each night.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"59a260b2-519c-5e5b-b1c7-1abb966f6697","frontmatter":{"title":"Workflow-1","publishedDate":"Aug 05 2019","excerpt":"This is an excerpt.","metaTitle":"Meta Title","metaKeywords":"Meta Keywords","metaDescription":"Meta Description","banner":"/assets/67545447_467977037322739_6235694920632369152_n.jpg","status":"Draft","description":"Description of this earth blog.","author":"John Doe","category":["Category1","Category2"],"tag":["Tag1","Tag2"]},"html":"<h1>Heading 1</h1>\n<p>The first eon in Earth's history, the Hadean, begins with the Earth's formation and is followed by the Archean eon at 3.8 Ga.[2]:145 The oldest rocks found on Earth date to about 4.0 Ga, and the oldest detrital zircon crystals in rocks to about 4.4 Ga,[34][35][36] soon after the formation of the Earth's crust and the Earth itself. The giant impact hypothesis for the Moon's formation states that shortly after formation of an initial crust, the proto-Earth was impacted by a smaller protoplanet, which ejected part of the mantle and crust into space and created the Moon.[37][38][39]</p>\n<p>From crater counts on other celestial bodies, it is inferred that a period of intense meteorite impacts, called the Late Heavy Bombardment, began about 4.1 Ga, and concluded around 3.8 Ga, at the end of the Hadean.[40] In addition, volcanism was severe due to the large heat flow and geothermal gradient.[41] Nevertheless, detrital zircon crystals dated to 4.4 Ga show evidence of having undergone contact with liquid water, suggesting that the Earth already had oceans or seas at that time.[34]</p>\n<p>By the beginning of the Archean, the Earth had cooled significantly. Present life forms could not have survived at Earth's surface, because the Archean atmosphere lacked oxygen hence had no ozone layer to block ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, it is believed that primordial life began to evolve by the early Archean, with candidate fossils dated to around 3.5 Ga.[42] Some scientists even speculate that life could have begun during the early Hadean, as far back as 4.4 Ga, surviving the possible Late Heavy Bombardment period in hydrothermal vents below the Earth's surface.[43]</p>\n<h2>Heading 2</h2>\n<p>Theories for the formation of the Moon must explain its late formation as well as the following facts. First, the Moon has a low density (3.3 times that of water, compared to 5.5 for the Earth[49]) and a small metallic core. Second, there is virtually no water or other volatiles on the Moon. Third, the Earth and Moon have the same oxygen isotopic signature (relative abundance of the oxygen isotopes). Of the theories proposed to account for these phenomena, one is widely accepted: The giant impact hypothesis proposes that the Moon originated after a body the size of Mars (sometimes named Theia[47]) struck the proto-Earth a glancing blow.[1]:256[50][51]</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"limit":10,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}}
